# Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

# Introduction

Our goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
1. Can help flag serious cases
2. Quickly identify healthy cases
3. And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors As such, this project is designed to test our ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images.This can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product.Our main task will be to create a data labeling job using [Appen's platform](https://client.appen.com/jobs). If we have not yet, we need to create an Appen account and login to complete this project.

If we intend to purchase any services through Appen, we need want to use a valid business email.so, we can receive notifications. But for the project, if we do not have a business email, we can use the above workaround in the meantime.

we will not be required to actually launch the data labeling job, we be evaluated on submitted documents and design only by Udacity mentor team.

# The Data

The dataset we'll be given is a modified version of this [Kaggle chest x-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), with most labels removed. Every piece of data is a chest x-ray image. We may see images taken that are slightly different in size and taken under slightly different exposure times. A typical, labeled image is shown below.

# What Does Pneumonia Look Like?

This is a challenging task because it is not always clear when pneumonia symptoms are present or not in an image. As such, your system is not meant to be a replacement for a doctor, only to aid in quickly identifying healthy patients and surfacing potential cases of pneumonia.

we should design a data annotation job, such that a non-expert can identify more noticeable cases of pneumonia. Since we are designing for a non-expert annotator, you should design for failure; this means including some way to capture uncertainty in your data labels and test questions.
