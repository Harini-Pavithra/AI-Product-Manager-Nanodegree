# Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

# Introduction

Our goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
1. Can help flag serious cases
2. Quickly identify healthy cases
3. And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors
As such, this project is designed to test our ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images.This can be used by ML engineers 
later on down the line to build a classification product.Our main task will be to create a data labeling job using (Appen's platform)[https://client.appen.com/jobs]. 
If we have not yet, we need to create an Appen account and login to complete this project.

If we intend to purchase any services through Appen, we need want to use a valid business email.so, we can receive notifications. But for the project, 
if we do not have a business email, we can use the above workaround in the meantime.

we will not be required to actually launch the data labeling job, we be evaluated on submitted documents and design only by Udacity mentor team.
