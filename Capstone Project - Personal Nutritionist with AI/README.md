# Capstone Project - Personal Nutrionist with AI Mobile Application

# Introduction 

In this project, we will develop a business proposal for an AI product. There are several important aspects of product development we need to think about and describe.
This project is open-ended in that we can propose any product in any industry that we want.

# Use Cases 

## The Business Goal

We need to describe what the product is, and how it will provide value to the business. It's important in this section to describe exactly what the 
product will do and why/how this helps the business.Focus on linking the AI/ML task to business goals such as increasing revenue or customer happiness.

## Success Metrics

We also need to describe how we will know whether the product is successful. Think about measurable, predictive, comparable, and benchmarked metrics for business success.

## Data

We should carefully consider how we will acquire the data to train our model, and issues that may arise during data collection. 
Important considerations include: buying data vs. collecting it, personally identifying information (PII) and data sensitivity, cost, and whether data will be 
continuously available or acquired in one large batch.

## Model

When thinking about how we will build the model, will we use an in-house data science team because none of the out of the box platforms have our use case, 
or because we want the ability to control a particular aspect of our model? Frequently, when we use an external platform to build and host the model, 
their terms of service will require us to give them access to our data. Will this be an issue?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Wq want to think about what our product is. What does it look like? Who uses it, and how do they use it? How will we actually build it?

## Post-MVP-Deployment

Finally, what happens after launch? How do we ensure our product continues to perform well? Who will monitor it, how will they monitor it, and how often?

# AI Product Business Proposal

We proposed, "Personal Nutrionist with AI" mobile application.The application (AI algorithm) will suggest food based on the calories needed, weight, height, medical history of the user, which helps for weight maintaining, loss and gain as well. In case, if the user in a situation to take more calories in a party or an event, then AI will suggest the 
foods, exercises to burn extra calories or fat. If the user doesn’t know the name of the food, then he/she can upload the photo of it.The AI will calculate the calories 
and suggest food accordingly.

The detailed desecription of the propsoal along with the use cases is available in the below file.
